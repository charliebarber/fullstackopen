# 2a Rendering a collection, modules

## Javascript Arrays
* Using functional programming methods of Javascript array
  * `find`
  * `filter`
  * `map`

### Higher order functions
* In functional programming, functions can be assigned to variables and passed around into other functions
  * This is useful for composition
    * compose a lot small functions into big functions
* One of most useful ones in JS is `filter` method
  * This is a function which passes each element of an array as an argument into a callback function
    * The callback function returns True or False on whether filter should include the argument in the new array
* Much quicker than writing long functions

* Map function
  * Callback function returns a transformed object to put in new array

* Reduce function
  * Callback functions take two arguments
    * Accumulator - the accumulated value from the last callback
    * currentValue - the current Value of the object that is being iterated over

## Rendering collections
* Can use map to render a list into seperate elements 
  * eg instead of hard coded index like so
  `<li>{note[1].content}</li>`
  * You can use map
  `notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)`

## Key attributues
* When elements are generated using the map functions, React requires you to add a `key` attribute
  * This allows React to determine how to update the view generated by a component when it gets re-rendered

## Anti-pattern: array indexes as keys
* Instead, you can use the index from an array as the key attribute
* You can pass a second parameter to callback function of `map`
  * `notes.map((note, i) => ...)`
  * i gets assigned the value of index where the current `note` resides
* This is not recommended and can cause undesired problems

## Refactoring modules
* A React app could all be in the same file, but its not very practical
* The common practice is to have a file for each component and import as an ES6-Module
* In smaller apps, we would put these in a */components* directory inside *src*
* Remember to import React to new component file
* Add `export default + component name` to export 
* Import with `import Component from './components/Component'`

## When the app breaks
* As JS is dynamically typed, the compiler does not check the data type of, for instance, function variables or return values
* Best way out is to console.log to find data types
* Often, when destructuring, an error occurs when props are expected to be of a different type or different name than what they really are.
